THIS SCRIPT WILL DELETE SHORTCUTS (Files ending in .url .exe .lnk) FROM YOUR DESKTOP 

Two Variations:
withConfirmations = You have to confirm doing this (so you don't risk accidentally deleting things)
withoutConfirmations = Just running the program will do it automatically

By default it is set to withConfirmations

CHANGE TO withoutConfirmations:
 	comment line 6 and uncomment line 7


CHANGE TO withConfirmations:
set to by default unless user has changed it but if you have:
	uncomment line 6 and comment line 7


I made this because I got annoyed of game shortcuts on my desktop whenever I installed them and this will delete them for me 

someone else might find this useful idk if so enjoy lol
